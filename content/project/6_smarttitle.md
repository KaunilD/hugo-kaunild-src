To gain practical insight into Natural Language Processing, I started reading and implementing papers related to NLP in academia.
This is the result of implementing the paper <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/reports/1.pdf">"Generating News Headlines with Recurrent Neural Networks"</a> using Chainer Framework.

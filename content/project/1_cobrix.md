Designed and implemented an ML Pipeline to classify real world objects as preset symbols. These symbols are then used to solve puzzles ( analogous to a compiler interpreting strings as instructions to a computer ). Backed by our accomplishment at MS Imagine Cup, Cobrix is now incubated in Georgia Tech's CreateX program.

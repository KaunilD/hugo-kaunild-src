In my bachelor year joined the Machine Learning Lab in KJSCE led by Prof. Kavita Kelkar to work on my project titled - <i>Learner Centric Affect Monitoring System </i>(<b>LCAMS</b>).

LCAMS is an eLearning system based on “Affective Computing” which constantly monitors students’ data across different modalities such as their facial expressions while watching videos, and movement of mouse and keyboard use for detecting whether the student understands the content or not. The lecture content and delivery methods change based on the emotions of the student - for example : by tailoring quizzes which focus on the subject areas that the student was found confused or distracted.
